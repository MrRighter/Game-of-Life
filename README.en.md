### Hello everyone. This is my first game written in Python using Pygame.

Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented by English mathematician John Conway in 1970. It is a playerless game in which a person creates an initial state and then only watches it evolve. The game can create processes with Turing completeness, allowing any Turing machine to be realized.

You can also find various “infinite” patterns on the vastness of the Internet, draw them and watch them move. One such is [Gosper glider gun](https://studme.org/htm/img/33/5860/planernoe-ruzhe-gospera.png).

### How to use:  
• it is possible to draw cells yourself (left mouse button) and erase (right mouse button). if you press a key and start driving, there will be an uninterrupted trace (or erasure depending on the key);  
• you can draw or erase only when the game is paused;  
• when the game is paused, you cannot open the additional menu of actions. you must "start" the game;  
• "pattern filling" is added for nothing, it is not what I described above.
